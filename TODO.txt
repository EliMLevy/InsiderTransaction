Streamline dataset download and extraction
- Auto download from EDGAR
- Auto unzip to correct directory.
-------
- Manually download zip files and move them into an extraction directory
- script will unzip every file in extraction dir into a dir for each zipfile
- Print out a json string of the filenames to be used in the main script


*****DONE***********

Streamline parameter construction
- There should be one file for the parameters 
- threshold, stop loss, expiration, etc.
- Start and end date
- important source files
---------
- The parameters will exist in a JSON file
- The main script will begin by reading the parameters
- Parameters: start_date, end_date, transaction_files, minimum_transaction_value,
filtered_transactions_output_file, cached_ticker_data_dir, valid_trade_days_file,
fragment_size (0<x<1), loss_stop (0<x<1), profit_target (1<x), expiration, 
starting_cash, simlation_output_file (csv), simlation_output_graph (png)

Output CSV and graph
- add graph construction to pipeline



-------------
WORKFLOW:
- Download datasets from EDGAR and place them in extraction dir
- run the extraction script and copy the output dirs to the params file
- In price_lookup script, set the start date and output dir 
- run the price_lookup to get valid trade days
- use the path to the outputted file in "valid trade_days" param
- Set all other params



-------------------
Multi year simulation
- Pass in all the directories for the EDGAR datasets
- pre load all years for the valid trades ticker by manually running the price lookup script for each year (unless its already computed)
